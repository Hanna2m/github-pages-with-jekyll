Ever since I was a child I liked creating all kinds of things. However, fate has decided otherwise and I have taught economics and mathematics. So, I got a Master's in Economic Cybernetic. Thanks to it Iâ€™m familiar with technology and numbers.

Fortunately, life throws unexpected surprises and sharp turns. Leaving the comfort zone was an amazing opportunity to realize my personal pursuit.

I took the UI/UX design course and did the first step in a new sphere and started crafting user interfaces. I worked for small startups and crafted products across the most popular platforms.

And now I begin a new chapter in my life. I start coding.

Every new task for me is an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a new field of knowledge and try to make human's everyday being even a little bit better.
